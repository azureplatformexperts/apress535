# To Do List Azure API App Sample #

This is a simple example that demonstrates how to build and consume [API apps](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/ "What are API Apps?") in Azure App Service. This example application uses a Web API middle tier API app, a Web API data tier API app, and an AngularJS client web app front end.  

This sample is used in the [getting-started series of tutorials for API apps](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-api-dotnet-get-started/). These tutorials show how to use API metadata, how to configure CORS, how to configure user authentication, and how to handle internal access using an Azure Active Directory service account.

To deploy the application to your Azure subscription without following the tutorial, use the **Deploy to Azure** button.
